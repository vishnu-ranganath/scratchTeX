Online TeX Notepad

Enter TeX expressions and see them transform into mathematical statements. Useful for performing calculations without using paper.

Improvements yet to be made:
- On-screen keyboard for easy editing
- Custom TeX Macros
- Dark mode?

This project uses the Javscript library KaTeX to render math, and the Javascript library html-to-image to take DOM screenshots.

The project is live now! See https://vishnu-ranganath.github.io/scratchTeX
