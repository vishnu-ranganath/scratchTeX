## ScratchTeX Documentation

### About ScratchTeX

ScratchTex is a tool intended to replace your scratchpad. You can use it to perform calculations when you don\'t have pencil and paper at hand. It supports a wide variety of \TeX instructions to help format your equations.

### Using ScratchTex

The ScratchTex user interface consists of two components: the equation editor, and the equation viewer. The equation viewer displays the equation(s) enterred into the equation editor, updated on each keystroke. The equation editor is a table with multiple rows, with each row representing an equation.

Equations can be appended, removed, or duplicated. It is also possible to remove all equations at once (be careful with this button).

Equations must be typed in LaTeX syntax (`\(\)` or `$$` not necessary). Some LaTeX formatting tools may not render correctly as a result of each equation having its own row in the table. These features include:
- Numbered Equations
- Alignment (more on this later)
- Other LaTeX features I have not discovered yet

### Supported LaTeX Commands
Most mathematical commands supported by LaTeX are supported by ScratchTeX. For a full list, check out https://katex.org/docs/supported.html (Katex is the TeX renderer used by ScratchTeX).
